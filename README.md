Clever Helper Scripts
=====================

This is just a collection of some of the scripts I have written to help with common dev tasks at Clever.


Scripts
-------

### remote
   Open the remote repository (most likely on Github) from the command line. Opens in your current branch (unless a branch is specified with -b branch).

### dev-server
   Start a dev-server with necessary env vars set. Specify the database to use, whether to check for vpn first, and whether to turn on debug.
